Modifies the Speed, Health, Slot and Socket count, Damage per shot, Reload Time and Maintenance of Ships and the Monster Gun (Zeppelin included)

This mod was made with the intention of making the game more realistic. 
Ships out of Wood will have a strongly decreased Health.
I have divided the cannons of the ships into small and big guns.
The Battlecruiser uses the big guns while every single other ship uses the small ones.
The Damage per shot depends on type of cannon and number of them in the ship.
The Old cannons need 14s to reload, big modern guns(Battlecruiser) need 10s and modern guns with Autloader(Monitor) need 5s.
The Monster Gun can now kill nearly every ship with a single shot but is therefore extremly fragile.
The Speed of Sailing Ships depends now on scale and number of Sails. Clipper and Ship of the Line are the fastest ones.

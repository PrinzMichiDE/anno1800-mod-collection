Archibalds Castle v1.4.1:

This Mod adds 11 modular buildable parts of a castle into the game (1 greater main building 2 main-buildings and 8 side-buildings), unlocked at 750 investors. The castle mainly consists of buildings from Archibald Blake (3rd Party) and some parts of other buldings.

Explanation: You got the choice! Do you want a straight castle but with an offset between the individual modules OR a crooked castle but with smooth connections between the modules

After you installed the mod, you can find the castle at the building-menu of investors (castle icon).

Just push Shift + v for choosing between the individual main-buildings (left icon) or side-buildings (right icon).

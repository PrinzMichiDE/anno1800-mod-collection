Historic_harbour v1.0.1:

This mod adds 3 new buildings: a new harbor master's office and 2 new warehouses. The appearance of the new building is based on the warehouse district of Hamburg

The new harbor master's office offers a total of 5 slots (push home/end button) and a 50% larger radius

The two warehouses have 30 tons more capacity than a normal warehouse

In return for their advantages, the new buildings are more expensive to maintain and more expensive to build

The new buildings will be unlocked at 3000 engineers


!!! This mod is compatible with previously started savegames. No unlocker is needed !!!


After installation, the new buildings can be found in the engineers harbour construction menu


Update 1.0.1 Notes:

  Bugfixes:
  
  - There should now be more workers walking around the new buildings

  - The ministry should now support the new harbor master's office

Motivation:
Getting the legendary specialist you need for your mega city in ANNO 1800 tends to be a boring rng fest and can take a long time and a lot of patience to achieve. The current way to counter this via mod is by adding the legendary specialist as options for vendors in the game.
However, in my opinion this takes away from their legendarieness and is either still heavily reliant on rng or feels very cheaty.
This mod introduces an avenue to get the specific legendary specialist you want, while being only moderately (appropriately) reliant on rng, staying difficult enough to feel worthy of legendaries and making use of (slightly) more interesting game mechanics than clicking a dice button a million times.

Requirements:
    * DLC - Sunken Treasures: Currently the mod requires Sunken Treasures to work. However it should be fairly straight forward to change some of the items required for the sets by changing the ids in the json and running the python script again, but I'm currently too lazy to support a non-DLC version.
    * Mod Loader: Like afaik any other mod currently created for ANNO 1800, this mod also requires the mod loader created by "Meow". You can either download it as part of the Spice It Up﻿ mod or download it directly from github﻿.


The Academy:
The main contribution this mod makes, is a new building called Academy which is similar to the museum or zoo, but allows to display items from the harbour office, guildhouse or townhall. Most displayed items will not have an effect, but some are part of special itemsets. Most of these sets will, when completed, buff the puplic mooring on the same island and greatly affect the pool of potential visitors. This allows to target specific legendary visitors much more precisely than before.
These set provide a way to work your way towards legendary items in a less random fashion (albeit you will still have to roll the vendors and hope for good world exhibition rewards to get the items required for the sets and then wait for island visitors).
Additionally the academy provides 4 strong (not imbalanced) buffs, which can be achieved through very difficult to complete itemsets.
    *Logistical Geniuses: 150% increased loading speed for all ships in the region (/session), including airships.
    *Perfected Harvesting: 20% productivity increase, -20% no. of modules.
    *Secure Mining: 150% decreased chance of fire.
	*Efficient Filamenting: 10% productivity increase for Filament Factory, additionaly it generates coal on every third cycle. 


Other Changes:
This mod addionally changes the time between visits to your islands from 30 Minutes to 20 Minutes, increases the maximum probability of special visitors to your island to 70 at 8500 Visitors and increases the probability that specialists visiting your islands are from an unlocked pool from 35% to 80%.
Visitor Sets:
As mentioned above, the probability that specialists that visit your island are from an unlocked pool, e.g. by a set from your academy is only 80%. Thus in a fifth of the cases you will still get visitors from the normal specialist pool appropriate to your city's status. Furthermore any other unlocked pool (e.g. via the New World Huaca museum set or via Mme. Elise "The Nose" Bouquet).

Altering the mod:
You can either change the asset.xml file directly or, generally easier, change the json file or the base.xml file and rerun the python script.

Adds a new steam based Warship with custom mesh and textures for the player to be build in the Steam Shipyard when reaching 1500 Investors.
The design features high hitpoints and damage ratings, but rather slow movement. It's like a real beefy Battleship, and not a 'cruiser'.

The strength of the Battleship is to counter large ships and is more vulnerable against small ships like monitors.
So Battleship defeats Battlecruisers which defeats Monitors that could defeat a Battleship when in larger numbers.
This choice was made to give this Ship a balance, otherwise it would just replace every other ship. Its still a very very strong Ship.

Mesh completely custom made in blender.
Most of the textures are custom made in Substance Painter and a few are modified original Files from Anno 1800.

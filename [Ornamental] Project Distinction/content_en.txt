This mod should have no compatibility issues, unless you have other mods that modifies your t4-5 residential buildings.

Save game compatible.

Compatible with most if not all other mods that does not modify your residential Tier 4 & 5 buildings. ( I built this mod while using spice it up, so there should be no issue there )

When in game, use shitf + v or your own shortcut that changes the building variations to see the new buildings. 

Bugs:

You may notice some texture clipping issues on some of the new buildings, fear not some day I will fix those.

You may notice when zoomed super far away some of the new buildings have a black box on them ( not noticeable ) if that is the case, you're shtout of luck. I haven't got a clue to how to fix that... (not a big issue unless you put your eyes on the screen)
